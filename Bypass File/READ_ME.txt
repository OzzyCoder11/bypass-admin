!! VERY IMPORTANT !!

This script's purpose is to allow you to run Setup Wizards without Administrator. This doesn't run it with admin (it can't make .exe files make changes to your PC)!

This file doesn't ask for Administrator permissions, it's safe.


Steps to run:

1. Add the application you can't run ( commonly .exe ). (e.g: SteamSetup.exe)
2. Run "RUN_HERE.exe". The code in this file will bypass the screen asking for admin.
3. You may need to wait...
4. Once it says it has found a file, check if it is the file you want, then press any key.
5. It should open the application!


! IF IT DOESN'T WORK !

If the script shows an error, try removing this .txt file out of the folder.
